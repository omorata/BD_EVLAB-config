# info about imsize, cell and mask
#
# the primary beam for X band is 4.43 arcmin (265.8 arcsec). We take 270
# arcsec
#
# cell size is taken from the dirty map, beamsize / [between 3 and 5]
# imsize = pb_size / cell_size
# mask is a box with center imsize/2 and size imsize*0.4
#
# IMPORTANT:
# due to the presence of an intense nearby source, the field is twice the
# size of the primary beam: 540 arcsec

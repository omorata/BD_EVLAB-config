#
# the primary beam for C band is 7.4 arcmin (444 arcsec). We take 450
# arcsec
#
# cell size is taken from the dirty map, beamsize / [between 3 and 5]
# imsize = pb_size / cell_size
# mask is a box with center imsize/2 and size imsize*0.4
#
# IMPORTANT:
# there are other sources in the field (mainly affecting the natural
# weighting)
